# Rails Front-end
We will be using SASS to help us use the bootstrap CSS library in Rails.

### Setup

Make sure you have the app running. Add a few songs in it. (All the add/insert functionality should already work)

The index page should display a list of songs.

Going to the index page: `http://localhost:3000` you should see a list of the songs.

### Static Assets
Rails is smart enough to put in the proper urls when it's a SASS file.

Choose an image file. Name it `pic.jpg` and put it in `app/assets/images`

Output an `image_url` in the view template to see where it goes.
```
<%= image_url 'pic.jpg' %>
```

Make an image tag with the url
```
<img src="<%= image_url 'pic.jpg' %>"/>
```

### Style our songs app

Implement a branding design guide in our app- these are styles that are consistent for the entire site.
 
![branding guide example](https://identitydesigned.com/images/mash/royal-mail/royal-mail-logo-6.jpg)

This guide will specify things like:
 - font type and size
 - 3-4 "brand" colors

You can create a color palette from [https://color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com)

### Install bootstrap
According to the instructions:

[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem#a-ruby-on-rails](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem#a-ruby-on-rails)


Add `bootstrap` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.1.0'
```

```
bundle install
```

Make some changes in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

Take out all require statements. ( they look like comments, but they are actually looked at by the pipeline system)

Import Bootstrap styles:

```scss
// Custom bootstrap variables must be set or imported *before* bootstrap.
@import "bootstrap";
```

Make sure the file has `.scss` extension (or `.sass` for Sass syntax). If you have just generated a new Rails app,
it may come with a `.css` file instead. If this file exists, it will be served instead of Sass, so rename it:

```console
mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
```

> Warning: the order of the import statements matter.

### bootstrap javascript & dependencies

Bootstrap JavaScript depends on jQuery.
Add the `jquery-rails` gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
```

Bootstrap tooltips and popovers depend on [popper.js] for positioning.
The `bootstrap` gem already depends on the
[popper_js](https://github.com/glebm/popper_js-rubygem) gem.

Add Bootstrap dependencies and Bootstrap to your `application.js`:

```js
//= require jquery3
//= require popper
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
```

### Asset Pipeline
Inside of your config file: `config/environments/development.rb`:

Check out the asset pipeline options:
Switch each of these and see how your assets change.

When debug mode is off, Sprockets concatenates and runs the necessary preprocessors on all files. With debug mode turned off the manifest above would generate instead:
```
config.assets.debug = false
```

When this option is true, digests will be generated for asset URLs. Put this option in to see what happens.
```
config.assets.digest = false
```

See what assets precompile does:
```
rails assets:precompile
```

Look in the place where rails *actually* serves the compiled assets from:
```
ls -la public/assets
```


### Style Our App
Use SASS to style our pages. Gitbook page here:[https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2018/06-ruby-rails/additional-topics/sass/readme.html](https://wdi-sg.github.io/gitbook-2018/06-ruby-rails/additional-topics/sass/readme.html)

The available variables can be found [here](assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss).

### Bootstrapify the song list.

app/views/songs/index.html.erb
```
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">#</th>
          <th scope="col">title</th>
          <th scope="col">created</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <% @songs.each do |song| %>
        <tr>
          <td><%= song.id %></td>
          <td class="song-title"><%= song.title %></td>
          <td><%= song.created_at.strftime('%d.%m.%Y') %></td>
        </tr>
      <% end %>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Song New Form:
Let's make some changes to the new form to conform with the bootstrap form. [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/)

You shouldn't need any additional styles for this page if your markup and classes use bootstrap.

#### Song Index Page
Make the top part of our index page a bootstrap jumbotron: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/)

Make sure it has a `container` and `row` bootstrap class `div` around it. (like the table markup below)

In `app/assets/stylesheets` make a new stylesheet `song-index.scss` and import it in `application.scss`.

In the new SASS file set a background image for the jumbotron. SASS and Rails are smart enough to put figure out that you want an asset image in your css:
```
background-image: asset-url('pic.jpg');
```

You can also use one from [unsplash.it](https://unsplash.it)

### Javascript in rails

Add a button
```
<button id="submit" type="button" class="btn">sort</button>
```

Add the listener:
```
var doSort = function(){
  alert("hello!");
};

window.onload = function(){
  $('#submit').click(doSort);
};
```
